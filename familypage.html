                        These are the people I grew up with, and our moms grew up together as well, which is why we have been friends before we could even talk.
                        I love my none-blood/blood family. This is all of us at my guys grad party.

                        These are my siblings and my cousin. I do not get to see them often since they still live in Minnesota, but I love them all the same. Whenever
                        we do see each other it is always an amazing time.
