                    <div class="title-slide">Where I am from.</div>
                    <div class="description">I was born and raised in Ramsey, Minnesota. My entire family is from the cold midwest. I am used to all the seasons at their extremes.
                        I now am in the Inland Empire of California. I did most of my upper level schooling in the Los Angeles Area. 
                        I love it here in California, but I do not want to live here forever. I want to explore new places and see what is out there.

                    <div class="title-slide">How would I describe myself.</div>
                    <div class="description">I would describe myself as someone hard working and always ready to learn. The more I learn the more excited I become. In my personal life I am caring and try to brighten up 
                        the day with a little bit of humor. I am very logic oriented, I love math, science and programming. I also love to think outside of the box.
                        I have always been a team player, and I naturally find myself in leadership positions.
